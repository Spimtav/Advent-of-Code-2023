# advent-of-code-2023
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles, as seen here: https://adventofcode.com/2023.  i probably won't get to all of them though, we'll see.  i might try playing around with Rust for the first time ever too, just for fun.

i like trying to connect coding puzzles to real situations that might come up in software dev, so i'm thinking about creating a couple of types of solutions per puzzle that optimize for various cases:
- readability and/or maintainability, ie: how can i make my coworkers not hate me
- not using any builtins, ie: can i peel back the abstraction layers and implement the underlying algorithms myself
- no builtins, and optimize for space, ie: pretend i'm back in the Olden Days Â© when 64Kb of RAM was the size of a skyscraper
- no builtins, and optimize for speed, ie: i'm racing my pal Sonic the Hedgehog, the Blue Blur himself. But he's like, racing through the computer?  idk but being a speedster is real fun.

Also: i don't guarantee that this is my best work haha.  But hopefully it'll at least be decent.
